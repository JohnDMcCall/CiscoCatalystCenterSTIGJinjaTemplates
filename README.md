# Introduction
Currently a WIP as I sanitize and refactor my existing templates to be able to provide for general use!!!

Cisco is currently rebranding their DNA Center into Catalyst Center - notation and documentation will mostly reflect the old name for some time. When importing the templates into DNAC the .jinja extension should be removed from the template names.

The templates were made using the assumptions of a cat9k SDA deployment with a LISP/BGP handoff to an upstream router. They are based off default LAN automation settings from DNAC and are intended to be used with a normal PNP deployment instead of LAN automation.
